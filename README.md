# Covid-19-DataPipeline
A Data Engineering Project that extracts data from Covid API and manipulates it to store and use for visualisations.

Project Description: Enhancing Data Engineering for COVID-19 Data Integration and Visualization Using Python and AWS

Overview:
This data engineering project focuses on building a robust pipeline to extract, transform, and load COVID-19 data from a REST API into a SQL database via Dataspell. The Python script incorporates AWS for task scheduling and cron jobs, optimizing the extraction of fresh data for each country. The dataset includes essential columns such as population, infection, death values, and a specialized function that computes the percentage of infection and death per country. Results are visualized using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Project Goals:
1. Develop a comprehensive data engineering pipeline for COVID-19 data integration using Python.
2. Utilize a REST API to efficiently retrieve COVID-19 data.
3. Integrate Dataspell for seamless loading of COVID-19 data into a SQL database.
4. Optimize data extraction by implementing a task scheduler and cron job on AWS.
5. Enhance the script to efficiently extract fresh COVID-19 data for each country.
6. Implement a specialized function to compute the percentage of infection and death per country.
7. Visualize COVID-19 data results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- Efficient loading of COVID-19 data into a SQL database using Dataspell.
- Optimization of data extraction for COVID-19 data using AWS task scheduler and cron job.
- Python scripting for data transformation, manipulation, and percentage computation.
- Visualization of COVID-19 data results using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Effective use of cloud services for task scheduling.

This project showcases my proficiency in designing and implementing a sophisticated data engineering pipeline for COVID-19 data integration. By leveraging Python, AWS, and Dataspell, I have created an efficient system that not only extracts data from a REST API but also optimizes the process through task scheduling and cron jobs. The addition of specialized functions, such as computing infection and death percentages per country, demonstrates my commitment to delivering comprehensive and insightful data. The integration of Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization adds a layer of clarity, making the data more accessible and meaningful. Overall, this project highlights my ability to tackle real-world challenges in data engineering, ensuring data accuracy, efficiency, and visualization for a more informed analysis of COVID-19 trends.
